# Try Polyverse

## Curious to try Polyverse? It only takes minutes!

### Sign up using our free promotional coupon code

* Start with: [https://polyverse.io/pricing.html](https://polyverse.io/pricing.html)

* If you're absolutely new to Polyverse, we recommend starting with the "Binary Scrambling"

* Sign up for the "Binary Scrambling" using the coupon code *polyversetrial*.

* When you sign up, you'll get an email to reset your password using the Forgot/Lost Password process. This ensures your password stays between you and Auth0 (whom we use to authenticate.)

* Once you have a password, login to: [https://store.polyverse.io/account_summary.html](https://store.polyverse.io/account_summary.html)

* You should see a page full of instructions on how to set up scrambled repositories on the Linux Distribution of your choice. There are also instructions to use Docker containers so you can do a completely sandboxed and isolated install.

  * A great side benefit of using the docker image is once you reinstall all packages, you can diff the container against the base image, thereby looking at just how much entropy was introduced from an attacker's perspective! That's how many new/different bits they have to parse through to understand what you're running.
